Libflangrt
================================

Libflangrt is a new implementation of the Fortran runtime library.
All of the code in libflangrt is dual licensed under the MIT license and the UIUC License (a BSD-like license). 

Libflangrt was created as a runtime library for flang (the Fortran frontend for LLVM, https://github.com/hyp/flang) 
as part of my GSoC 2013.
It is used by flang right now, but it can be used by any other Fortran compiler.

TODO:
